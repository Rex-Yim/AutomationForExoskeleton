# DeepLearningForExoskeleton
Final Year Project: Robotic Exoskeleton for Load Transportation (Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong)
Sep 2025 â€“ May 2026 at CUHK, Shatin, Hong Kong

Project awarded Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP) Tech FYP Sponsorship.
- Developing intention detection algorithm using MATLAB to predict user locomotion modes (walking, stair ascent/descent) and state transitions (sit-to-stand).
- Engineering multi-sensor data processing pipeline: Fused IMU data (accelerometer, gyroscope) via Kalman filtering (imufilter) to estimate accurate hip and knee kinematics in real-time.
- Training and deploying machine learning models (SVM, LSTM) using MATLAB's Statistics & ML and Deep Learning Toolboxes, achieving high classification accuracy for terrain recognition.
- Potential Results: Enabled proactive and seamless power assistance by translating predicted user intent into control signals for the exoskeleton's actuators, enhancing stability and reducing metabolic cost for the user.
